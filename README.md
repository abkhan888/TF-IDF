# TF-IDF
What is tf-idf and how it is used in nlp?

TF-IDF is a numerical statistic used in text analysis and information retrieval to reflect the importance of a word in a document relative to a collection of documents (corpus). 

Calculation for tf-idf:

Tf=number of times the term appears in the document/total numbers of terms in the document

Idf=log*(total number of document/number of documents that contain the term)

TF-IDF=Tf*Idf
